This is the edX submission of WHM by Thomas Ralls.

This project took way longer than I expected, but one idea led to another and I wanted it to fully represent where I am today
as an aspiring developer. Plus I had fun putting it all together. This application is not only my final project for CS50, but it
will also give me something to show to potential mentors and will hopefully help get me into a program to take these new skills to
the next level.

This program is currently in a complete state and I will not make updates to this version. As I use it on my personal
server and as I get feedback from others, I may make tweaks in the future. Updates can be found here:

As per the project specifications, a video demo is to follow this submission. It will be linked in the README.md of the linked
version of the project above (not this submission).

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project.
